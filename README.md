# Corporate Finance Final Project

A group of 2 students will choose a public company, each group should choose a different company, and submit the following task:

o    A financial statements analysis of at least the latest five years periods,
o    A financial projection of 1 year based on above point,
o    A short descriptive sector analysis about the sector industry and the company.

For example, Kalbe Farma’s financial analysis includes pharmaceutical sector analysis. Financial statement analysis must include, but not limited to, financial ratio analysis and calculation of the firm’s cost of capital. Financial projection includes pro-forma financial statements analysis. Each group will have to deliver a presentation on week 13


# Financial Statements Analysis

### 1. **Trend Analysis**

* **Revenue Growth** : Evaluate *year-over-year growth* in revenue to determine if the company has been expanding its sales or facing stagnation or decline.
* **Expense Patterns** : Identify trends in operational costs, cost of goods sold (COGS), and other expenses to assess operational efficiency.
* **Profitability Trends** : Analyze changes in gross profit, operating profit, and net income to see if profitability is improving or declining.

### 2. **Ratio Analysis**

* **Liquidity Ratios** :
  * **Current Ratio** = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
  * **Quick Ratio** = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
    * These ratios indicate the company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations.
* **Profitability Ratios** :
  * **Gross Margin** = Gross Profit / Revenue
  * **Operating Margin** = Operating Income / Revenue
  * **Net Profit Margin** = Net Income / Revenue
    * Profitability ratios help assess how well the company is controlling costs and generating returns.
* **Solvency Ratios** :

    Debt-to-Equity Ratio** = Total Debt / Total Equity

* **Interest Coverage Ratio** = Operating Income / Interest Expense
  * These ratios measure the company’s reliance on debt and its ability to cover debt obligations.
* **Efficiency Ratios** :
  * **Inventory Turnover** = COGS / Average Inventory
  * **Receivables Turnover** = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable
  * **Asset Turnover** = Revenue / Total Assets
    * Efficiency ratios indicate how effectively the company uses its assets to generate revenue.
* **Market Ratios** (for publicly traded companies):
  * **Earnings per Share (EPS)** = (Net Income - Dividends on Preferred Stock) / Outstanding Shares
  * **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio** = Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share
  * These ratios provide insights into market perception and valuation.

### 3. **Cash Flow Analysis**

* **Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)** : Look at cash generated from core business operations to gauge the company’s liquidity and operational strength.
* **Cash Flow from Investing (CFI)** : Examine capital expenditures and investments to understand growth strategy and long-term plans.
* **Cash Flow from Financing (CFF)** : Review financing activities such as debt issuance, repayment, dividends, and stock buybacks, which show how the company funds itself.
* **Free Cash Flow** = CFO - Capital Expenditures: Indicates how much cash the company generates after funding capital expenses, critical for assessing reinvestment ability.

### 4. **Comparative Analysis**

* **Benchmarking with Industry Peers** : Compare financial ratios, growth rates, and margins against industry averages or specific competitors to assess relative performance.
* **Horizontal Analysis** : Look at year-over-year changes within the company’s own financials to see growth or contraction in revenues, costs, and profits.
* **Vertical Analysis** : Review each financial statement line item as a percentage of a base figure (e.g., revenue in the income statement, total assets in the balance sheet) to identify structural changes.

### 5. **Common-Size Financial Statements**

* Convert each line item in financial statements into a percentage of a total (e.g., total assets for the balance sheet or total revenue for the income statement). This helps in identifying how the company’s financial structure has shifted over time.

### 6. **Management Discussion and Notes Review**

* **Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A)** : Provides insights into the strategic direction, key achievements, and challenges faced by the company.
* **Financial Statement Notes** : Important for understanding accounting policies, unusual transactions, and contingent liabilities.

### 7. **Quality of Earnings**

* Analyze whether earnings are backed by actual cash flows. Companies with high earnings quality have a strong correlation between net income and cash flows from operations, indicating earnings are less likely to be influenced by accounting adjustments.

### 8. **Assessment of Financial Health and Risk Factors**

* **Credit Risk** : Examine debt levels, repayment schedules, and coverage ratios to understand the company's risk of default.
* **Operational Risks** : Look at fixed costs, variable costs, and break-even analysis to understand the financial impact of changes in sales volume.
* **Market and Regulatory Risks** : Review any relevant disclosures about market risks, regulatory changes, or economic factors impacting the business

# Financial Projection


### 1. **Income Statement Projection**

* **Revenue Forecast** : Begin by projecting sales or revenue growth, based on factors like historical growth rates, market trends, and any anticipated changes (e.g., launching new products or entering new markets).
* **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** : Estimate costs directly tied to production, such as materials and labor. COGS is often a percentage of revenue, so using a historical margin may be a good starting point.
* **Gross Profit** : Calculated by subtracting COGS from revenue. Gross profit projections help assess profitability from core business activities.
* **Operating Expenses** : Forecast key expenses like marketing, R&D, and administrative costs. Some expenses may be fixed, while others may vary with sales.
* **Operating Income (EBIT)** : Subtract operating expenses from gross profit to get earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), a measure of core operating performance.
* **Interest and Taxes** : Estimate interest expenses based on expected debt levels, and taxes based on the applicable tax rate.
* **Net Income** : The final line, showing projected profit after all expenses and taxes. Net income is key for estimating future profitability and valuation.


### 2. **Balance Sheet Projection**

* **Assets** :
* **Current Assets** : Project cash, accounts receivable, and inventory based on revenue and operational needs.
* **Fixed Assets** : Include long-term assets like property, plant, and equipment. Factor in new investments and depreciation.
* **Liabilities** :
* **Current Liabilities** : Estimate accounts payable, accrued expenses, and short-term debt, based on past ratios and future needs.
* **Long-term Debt** : Include projections of new debt issuances or repayments. Adjust this based on planned financing activities.
* **Equity** :
* **Retained Earnings** : Roll forward with net income projections and dividends.

### 3. **Cash Flow Statement Projection**

* **Cash Flow from Operations** : Start with projected net income, then adjust for non-cash items (e.g., depreciation) and changes in working capital (e.g., accounts receivable, inventory).
* **Cash Flow from Investing** : Forecast capital expenditures (CAPEX) for business expansion and any expected returns from investments or asset sales.
* **Cash Flow from Financing** : Include expected debt issuance, repayments, and any planned dividends or stock buybacks.



### 4. **Key Assumptions and Sensitivity Analysis**

* **Revenue Growth Rates** : Assumptions about market growth, market share, and pricing strategy.
* **Cost Assumptions** : Estimates for COGS and operating expenses, including fixed and variable portions.
* **Capital Expenditures and Financing** : Plans for investments in assets, equipment, and sources of financing (e.g., loans or equity).
* **Tax Rates** : Assumptions about the tax environment


### 5. **Key Metrics and Ratios**

* **EBITDA Margin** : EBITDA / Revenue, to assess operational efficiency.
* **Return on Assets (ROA)** : Net Income / Total Assets, a measure of how effectively assets are generating profit.
* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio** : Total Debt / Equity, indicating financial leverage.
* **Free Cash Flow (FCF)** : Cash from operations - CAPEX, showing available cash for reinvestment or dividends.


# Short Descriptive Sector Analysis


**Sector Analysis: Digital Advertising and Social Media**

The digital advertising and social media sector is a rapidly evolving industry driven by technological advancements, increasing internet penetration, and a growing demand for personalized content and experiences. This sector includes social media platforms, search engines, and content-sharing platforms that monetize through advertising and subscription-based models. Global digital ad spending has shown strong growth over the past decade, and the trend is expected to continue, with advertisers increasingly shifting budgets from traditional media to digital channels to reach target audiences more effectively.

With over 4.5 billion social media users worldwide as of 2024, the industry is characterized by high engagement, real-time user interactions, and significant data generation. Key players in this space, such as Meta (Facebook), Google (Alphabet), and TikTok (ByteDance), leverage advanced data analytics and AI to offer precise audience targeting, which in turn drives advertising revenue. However, the sector faces challenges related to data privacy concerns, regulatory scrutiny, and competition, particularly from emerging platforms and new technologies like generative AI and augmented reality (AR).

**Company Overview: Meta Platforms, Inc. (Facebook)**

Meta, initially launched as Facebook in 2004, is one of the most prominent players in the digital advertising and social media sector. The company owns popular platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, collectively boasting a monthly active user base of nearly 3 billion people. In 2021, Meta rebranded itself to reflect its vision of a “metaverse” future—an interconnected digital universe enhanced by AR and virtual reality (VR). This strategic shift underscores Meta’s ambition to expand beyond social media into a broader digital ecosystem encompassing social interaction, gaming, shopping, and workspaces.

Meta’s revenue model relies primarily on digital advertising, which accounted for approximately 98% of its total revenue in 2023. By utilizing its extensive data assets and AI-driven algorithms, Meta can offer targeted advertising solutions that are highly valuable to businesses. However, the company is increasingly investing in VR and AR through its Reality Labs division, a high-cost segment aimed at driving long-term innovation. Meta’s financial performance has remained robust, with strong profitability metrics, although costs associated with metaverse development have led to an uptick in capital expenditure and operating expenses.

**Financial Summary (2023)**

Meta’s financial ratios demonstrate strong liquidity, profitability, and operational efficiency. Its return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) are indicators of effective asset utilization, though recent expenditures on the metaverse initiative have led to compressed operating margins. The company maintains a low debt-to-equity ratio, reflecting a conservative approach to leverage, and enjoys a strong free cash flow position, which supports ongoing investments in innovation.
